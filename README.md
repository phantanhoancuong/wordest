# Wordest

**Wordest** is a re-creation of the word puzzle that I think you know, built with **React** and **Next.js**.

In case you don't know, the goal is to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts.

- Each guess must be a valid word of the correct length.
- After each guess, each letter will be highlighted to show feedback:
  - Correct letter in the correct position
  - Correct letter in the wrong position
  - Incorrect letter
- Use the feedback to refine your next guesses.
- The game ends when you guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.

You can play it live at:

## Planned Features

**Wordest** started as a simple game, but I plan to extend it with more features over time.  
Some ideas (they may not all be implemented; these are just concepts I think would be nice) include:

### Gameplay

- Custom word lengths and attempts
- Difficulty levels (different word lists)
- Timer mode
- Hint system
- Custom word dictionary API
- Hard mode (enforce reusing known correct letters in later guesses)

### UI / UX

_(I try to adhere to good UX / UI design principles)_

- Content fitting one screen
- Dark and Light themes
- Animated feedback
- Sound effect feedback
- Dynamic layout between mobile and desktop

### Stats and Progression

_(Might be implemented last)_

- Player statistics (games played, win rate, streaks, accuracy)
- Achievements and badges
- History log
- Practice mode (no stat tracking)

## Feedback

I plan to keep improving **Wordest** and continue building other small web-based projects such as websites, interactive tools, and mini-games to explore design, animation, and front-end architecture.
